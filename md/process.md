## How do you design a user friendly website?
Note:
User Experience can also come in form of a physical item or service, not just a website.


## 5 stages of UX design process:
- Research
- Design
- Testing
- Iteration
- Implementation
Note:
- Research (The problem)  
- Design (The Solution)  
- Testing (The Solution)  
- Iteration (The Solution)  
- Implementation (The Solution and be available for feedback after the implementation from real world users)


# Research
Note:
How to help with your research  
Create different user personas  
Surveys  
Interviews  
Closed environment study  
analytics


## Empathize:
Gain a deep understanding of end-user and their needs. 
Is navigating around the site efficient and easy to understand?

## Prototype:
Create a scaled-down version of the proposed solution for testing. 
Don't overbuild the prototypes but focus on the most important aspects of the design and usability.

# Testing
Gather user feedback and iterate on the design.

# Iteration
Iterate your design multiple times while going through the steps of design thinking again.
